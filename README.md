# Portfolio 

A minimal protfolio. I quite liked this template. I added an additional section and a button that allows you to download my CV. Made using NextJS and Tailwind CSS. I got a free student *.codes* domain from *name.com* so now it's live on [shamsur.codes](https://www.shamsur.codes/) and hosted on Vercel. I would quite like to add a blog section later on. Maybe some more interactivity. However, all in the name of minimalism.
